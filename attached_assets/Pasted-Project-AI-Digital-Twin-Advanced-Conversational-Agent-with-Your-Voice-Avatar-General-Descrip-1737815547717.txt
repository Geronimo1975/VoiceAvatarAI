Project: AI Digital Twin – Advanced Conversational Agent with Your Voice & Avatar
🔹 General Description
This project develops an AI Digital Twin capable of:

📞 Answering phone calls automatically using your cloned voice
💬 Sending WhatsApp messages in English & German
🎥 Joining video meetings (Zoom, Teams, Meet) using a digital avatar synchronized with AI responses
📄 Processing PDF documents uploaded to a "Data" directory for professional interactions
🤖 Leveraging Llama + LangChain + Hugging Face for advanced conversational AI
🔄 Using n8n / Make.com / CrewAI for workflow automation and fine-tuning
💻 Providing a dynamic UI without mandatory login, similar to Replit.com
🔹 Required Technologies
🛠 Component	🚀 Technology
🎙️ Voice Cloning	ElevenLabs
📹 Digital Avatar	HeyGen API
☎️ Phone Calls	Twilio Voice API
💬 WhatsApp Messaging	Twilio WhatsApp API
🧠 Conversational AI	Llama + LangChain + Hugging Face
🔄 Automated Workflows	n8n / Make.com / CrewAI
📂 Document Processing	"Data" Directory + AI for PDF Analysis
🎥 Video Calls	OBS Studio + HeyGen API
🖥️ Backend	Python (TypeScript is NOT allowed!)
🌐 UI	Dynamic structure like Replit.com (no mandatory login)
🔹 Final Prompt for Replit Agent
"Create an advanced AI Digital Twin that can answer phone calls, send WhatsApp messages, and join video meetings using the user's voice and avatar.

🔴 IMPORTANT: All files must be in Python. Do NOT use TypeScript!
🔴 The UI must have a dynamic structure, without mandatory login at startup, similar to Replit.com.

🔹 Technical Integration:

📞 Phone Calls → Twilio Voice API + ElevenLabs for AI-driven responses using the user's voice
💬 WhatsApp Messaging → Twilio WhatsApp API + Llama for intelligent conversations in English & German
🎥 Video Calls → HeyGen API + OBS Studio for a realistic digital avatar synchronized with AI responses
🧠 Conversational AI → Llama + LangChain + Hugging Face for fluent, natural AI conversations
🔄 Automated Workflows → n8n / Make.com / CrewAI for managing AI interactions and fine-tuning responses
📂 "Data" Directory → Users can upload PDF files, and the AI will process them to generate professional responses
🔹 Additional Requirements:

🚀 The AI must have conversational memory and continuously improve its responses
⚡ The system architecture must be scalable and flexible for future expansions
🖥️ The backend must be written in Python (TypeScript is strictly NOT allowed!)
🌐 The UI must be dynamic and function without requiring initial authentication, similar to Replit.com
🔹 Next Steps
1️⃣ Implement voice cloning (ElevenLabs) & digital avatar (HeyGen API)
2️⃣ Set up Twilio API for phone calls & WhatsApp messaging
3️⃣ Integrate conversational AI (Llama + LangChain + Hugging Face)
4️⃣ Connect workflow automation (n8n / Make.com / CrewAI)
5️⃣ Develop the "Data" directory for PDF document analysis
6️⃣ Build the UI with a Replit.com-like dynamic structure (no mandatory login)
